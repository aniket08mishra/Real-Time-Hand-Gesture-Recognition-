# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-
This Python project uses MediaPipe and OpenCV for real-time hand gesture recognition, allowing users to control their computerâ€™s cursor and keyboard via hand movements. Left-hand gestures control the mouse (e.g., cursor movement, click), and right-hand gestures simulate arrow keys, creating an accessible, hands-free interaction experience.
