# **Gesture Recognition with Hand Tracking**

This project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyAutoGUI** to enable real-time gesture recognition and control for a computer screen. Using a webcam feed, the program detects hand gestures to simulate mouse movements and keyboard actions, such as swipe gestures and a "rock gesture" to control the spacebar.

## Overview
This project provides a hand-gesture-controlled interface to interact with computer screens through specific hand movements. It translates gestures into on-screen actions, allowing you to:
- Control the mouse pointer with your left hand.
- Simulate keyboard swipes with your right hand.
- Use a specific "rock gesture" to trigger the spacebar.

## Features
- **Mouse Control:** Use your left hand to control the mouse pointer.
- **Swipe Gestures:** Swipe up, down, left, or right to trigger keyboard arrow keys.
- **Rock Gesture:** Use a "rock gesture" with your right hand to simulate pressing the spacebar.
